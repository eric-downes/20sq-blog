$$\partial_xb<0$$ culd obtain at some point due to inherent
demand... people will reinvest less in staking because they can get a
higher return (possibly not APY but lnger ter return) elsewhere within
their risk appetite.

previously we said

* At very long times, under any sub-linear issuance regime, such as
  the preset one, an inflation rate sufficient for LI;ELF cannot
  maintain.  Inflation approaches zero *unless* the magnitude APY of the
  ether burned via EIP 1559 shrinks relative to issuance APY
  $$|B|\lessim I$$.  This exception seems unreasonable to depend upon.

* Thus it seems that the medium term future of ethereum is one in wich
  inflation $$\alpha$$, while higher than that prefered by inflation
  hawks, plays a *positive* role to mediate staking fraction and
  centralization.  In long $$t\to\infty$$ term, $$\alpha\to0$$
  forcing $$s\to1$$.  We will revisit the consequences of this for
  Ethereum in a future blog post.

nw we say

* However, this medium term will be only temporary; the long-term
  future of Ethereum is exactly as the Ethereum researchers fear:
  mostly just infrastructure for L2s (which might become their own
  LSPs) with nearly all ether staked.

* So, if decentralization remains a brand feature and core goal of
  Ethereum, in the long term, it falls to L2 governance and decentralized liquid
  staking, if such is truly possible, to ensure this.
