ETH is used for
- gas: powering smart contracts
- collateral: investing, gambling, loans, etc., token issuance
- consensus: validation
- trading: number go up/down

With LSTs, only gas cannot be replaced in principle.  Wether lstETH
replaces ETH up to the risk profiles and values of market
participants.  To the extent that values are "luxury beliefs" we
should not depend on them escaping dysfunctional nash equilibria, and
this is the central organizing insight of crypto-economics: use
incentive alignment so that a functoning system (decentralized publlic
goods) becomes a Schelling point.
