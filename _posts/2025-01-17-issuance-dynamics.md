# Ethereum Macroeconomics

This is the first of two posts on Ethereum macroeconomics.

Ethereum has grown into a [major economic force](
 https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/the-battle-for-value-in-smart-contract-platforms);
between its native asset Ether (ETH), the smart contract ecosystem
this supports, and the Layer-2 blockchains, a conservative valuation
might be half a trillion dollars.  At the core of Ethereum's "brand",
distinguishing it from other smart contract platforms, is the
consistent effort put into decentralized governance.  Via its
[consensus mechanism](
    https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/)
no central authority can censor a transaction, freeze the native asset
of a user, etc.  This brand commitment depends in turn on a sufficient diversity of
validators staking ETH to participate in consensus.

The share of Ether staked by "centralized" staking services, such as
exchanges and Liquid Staking Providers (LSPs) [is considerable](
    https://dune.com/queries/2394100/3928083), and continues
to grow.  This has provoked [concerns](https://issuance.wtf/), among
Ethereum researchers that the future of Ethereum might involve a
confluence of three interrelated challenges

1. Nearly all Ether becomes staked.
1. Inflation becomes excessive.
1. Governance becomes centralized.

upon which we focus.  The view of inflation emphasized
in this work in particular feels quite different to us, than the views
expressed for instance, in this [very helpful review podcast](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivynR3RI3_Y).

## Lookahead

In this blog post we address the first of these concerns "runaway
(near 100%) staking" $$s\to1$$ and how it relates to the second,
using a "stock and flow" macroeconomics model built with guidance from
dynamical system theory.  In contrast with other research, we find
inflation playing a positive role in moderating runaway staking, but
eventually inflation must subside, along with the moderation it
provides.

In the second post, we look more closely at governance centralization
and discuss a means for evaluating macroeconomic interventions inspired
by bifurcation theory.  Briefly, we are not optimistic that reducing
issuance will prevent governance centralization, either.

In both posts, we provide a few code examples using
[ethode](https://github.com/20squares/ethode/), a thin units-aware
wrapper we built around `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to streamline
model evaluation.  Readers desiring to follow our derivations, dive
into technical mathematical points not covered here, run their own
simulations, or learn some dynamical systems are recommended to look
at our ethode
[guide](https://github.com/20squares/ethode/blob/master/guide/guide.md),
which contains [References](#dynamical-systems-references) section
below.  The guide is certainly a work in progress, but should have
enough to get you going.

## For The Impatient!

Issuance does not all get dumped into native unstaked Ether.  Some
portion of it is reinvested by staking businesses at ratio $r$; indeed
this process is coded into Liquid Staking Token (LST) smart contracts.
 
It is important to distinguish between transient behavior, such as
speculation in staking, and medium/long-term behavior, such as the
reinvestment of staking rewards by staking businesses.  When staking
is dominated by reinvestment instead of speculation, inflation
persistently decreases.

We use our macroeconomics model to identify a friend "Mr.LI;ELF":
"Medium $r$. Low Inflation; Even Lower Fees".  Without Mr.LI;ELF
convergence to a desirable future without runaway staking is unlikely.  Strong
deflation, in which the magnitude of deflation exceeds the
reinvestment of transaction fees, probably corresponds to unstable
dynamics.  Under zero or weak deflation, the tendency toward runaway
staking can be moderated only by high churn and/or slashing.

In contrast with Mr.LI;ELF staked ETH fraction approaches to a value
above moderate reinvestment ratio $r$.  How far above depends on the
"ELF" part.  Thus, runaway staking can be avoided only while inflation
is held

1. low enough, that concerns over inflation do not dominate the
reinvestment of profits by staking businesses at equilibrium,
$$\left(\frac{dr}{d\alpha}\right)^\star<0$$ (no news here) but simultaneously

1. high enough to not be numerically dominated by the reinvestment of
priority fees and MEV, as a fraction of unstaked Ether;
$$\alpha^\star\gtrsim r^\star f^\star$$.

Inflation will *eventually* decay though, driving the equilibrium
point itself $$s^\star\to1$$, though it may
take considerable time.  This "L2 future" has been recognized by many
others: most Ether is staked, with the majority used for settlement of
L2 rollups.  We'll discuss it more next time.

Given all the above, we advise caution.  Intervening to reduce the
issuance yield curve seems quite capable of exacerbating the very
problems we seek to avoid.

## Modeling an Open Zeppelin[^humor]

First, a warning!  In an act of hubris, and with apologies, but not
without reasons[^reasons], we have chosen $$S$$ to refer to Staked ETH,
while others have at times used $$S$$ for "circulating (S)upply", which
we call instead $$A$$, so $$s=S/A$$.  Please proceed!

![Ethereum as a balloon with compartments.](
    ../assetsPosts/2025-01-17-issuance-dynamics/eth-balloon.jpg)

Consider a "balloon" with variable internal compartments.  The average
size of each is measured by *stocks*

- ($$S$$)taked Ether (participating in consensus) is a compartment, as is
- ($$U$$)nstaked unburnt Ether,
  -- containing the ($$V$$)alidator reward queue.
- ($$\cancel{O}$$) is all irrecoverable (burned, lost, etc.) Ether, and
- ($$A$$)ccessible/Circul($$A$$)ting Ether supply, $$A=S+U\approx120.4\times10^6$$ in Dec 2024.
- $$\mathcal{Q}_\pm$$ the Ether in the staking ($$+$$) and unstaking ($$-$$) queues

The net change in time of a stock is written using a dot, such as
$$\frac{dA}{dt}:=\dot{A}$$[^partial], the net change in accessible Ether
supply.  Stocks grow or shrink based on flows which add to or subtract
from their derivatives.  Here all flows are positive real numbers with
units \[ETH/yr\].

By averaging over "long" timescales (at least quarterly)[^aves] we
approximate the staking and unstaking queues as equilibrated, and
average over many cycles of the
[erratic](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-10-eip1559/)
base fee oscillations.

So, our conceptual model:

$$\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{A} &=& I - B - J\\
\dot{V} &=& I + P - R - K\\
\dot{U} - \dot{V} &=& K + Q_- - Q_+ - F\\
\dot{S} &=& R + Q_+ - Q_- - J\\
\end{array}
$$

| Flow Name        | Symbol | Domain $$\to$$ Codomain[^cats] | Constraint |
| :--              | :--    | :-:                          | :--        |
| Tx Fees          | $$F$$    | $$U\to\cancel{O},V$$       | $$B+P=F<U$$ |
| Base Fees[^aves] | $$B$$    | $$U\to\cancel{O}$$         | .. |
| Priority Fees    | $$P$$    | $$U\to V$$                 | ..       |
| Issuance[^aves]  | $$I$$    | $$\cdot\to V$$             | $$I\leq yS$$ |
| Slashing         | $$J$$    | $$S\to\cancel{O}$$         | $$J<S$$ |
| Unstaking        | $$Q_-$$  | $$S\to U$$                 | $$Q_-<S$$ |
| New Staking      | $$Q_+$$  | $$U\to S$$                 | $$Q_++R<U$$ |
| Reinvestment[^whyr] | $$R$$ | $$V\to S$$                 | $$R+K+\dot{V}=I+P$$ |
| Costs & Profits  | $$K$$    | $$V\to U$$                 | ..        |

Flows $$(B,J,Q_-,\ldots)$$ have a "domain" $$(U,S,S,\ldots)$$, where
the flow is coming from, and a "codomain"
$$(\cancel{O},\cancel{O},U,\ldots)$$, where the flow is going
to.[^cats] Flows obey constraints, often expressed as (in)equalities
relating a flow to its domain.  In case you've forgot or are skimming,
(co)domains are summarized in [this glossary](
    #Glossary-of-Things-That-Have-Dots-or-Dot-Adjacent-Shapes).

In response to the concerns about $$s\to1$$, the recent [Deneb upgrade](
    https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/deneb/beacon-chain.md)
implemented [EIP 7514](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7514), an
upper limit on $$R+Q_+$$ chosen so as to not limit any present flows.
We also ignore the pre-existing symmetric limits on (un)staking
$$Q_\pm$$.  The purpose of our models is to show, in the absence of
such limits, where the dynamics push the system.  If you wish to study
an extreme of dynamics post-Deneb, you could make $$R+Q_+$$ constant;
we will revisit EIP 7514 in our next post in this series, on staking
*composition*.  So the constraints ($$Q_-<S,Q_+<U$$) could be
tightened significantly, but more accurate upper limits would play
little role in our analysis.

A few flows deserve specific comment: $$I$$ and $$(R,Q_+,K)$$.

### Bounding Issuance

All of these stocks and flows, $$(I,S,\ldots)$$, are moving
time-averages over *spot values* $$(I^\bullet,S^\bullet,\ldots)$$
defined at a given block.  For issuance, we'll assume that

1. Issuance is sublinear $$1\ll I\approx yS\ll S$$[^asym] to
avoid [discouragement attacks](
    https://github.com/20squares/ethode/blob/master/guide/guide.md),
and that

2. The large-stake scaling of yield (like, on a log-log plot) is not
substantially altered by time averaging
$$\frac{\partial{d\log{y}}}{\partial{d\log{S}}}
\approx\frac{\partial{d\log{y}^\bullet}}{\partial{d\log{S^\bullet}}}$$.[^vitalikp]

The first is common and almost certainly an overestimate with
$I\leq{yS}$ more precise.  We reason as follows.  We can express spot
issuance as a known function of the yield curve $$I^\bullet =
y^\bullet S^\bullet$$.  From this we obtain an inequality for the
quarterly-averaged issuance $I\leq yS$ using time-covariance.

$$\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rcl}
I &=& \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t-\tau}^ty^\bullet S^\bullet dt'\\
 &\approx& yS + \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t-\tau}^t(y^\bullet-y)(S^\bullet-S)dt'\\
 &=& yS - |COV(y^\bullet,S^\bullet)|\\
I &\leq& yS
\end{array}
$$

Other approximations are also possible, see
[guide](https://github.com/20squares/ethode/blob/master/guide/guide.md#bounding-persistent-inflation).
This should work for any positive definite yield curve with finite
slope, erring in a conservative direction without explicit dependence
on the present curve $y^\bullet = y_0(1)/\sqrt(S^\bullet)$ with
$y_0(1)\approx166.3$/yr.  We deem this a good direction in which to
err in light of our results concerning (the lack of) runaway
inflation.

### Bounding Reinvestment

Reinvestment of staking rewards by validators $$R$$ is achieved by
staking a new validator from existing rewards, or
post-[Electra](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251) increasing the
stake on an existing validator.  While clearly a stochastic process,
we approximate the net effect as smooth on timescales of at least
$$\tau$$.  $$R$$ represents a feedback loop
$$S\overset{+}{\rightsquigarrow}S$$ quite evidently related to the
potential positive-feedback between staking and inflation that people
have found concerning.

To express this concept succinctly in one flow variable, we require
that the averaging timescale $$\tau$$ be adjusted upward until most
validators claim and reinvest the bulk of their staking rewards
within it.  That is $$\dot{V}=0$$, so $$R+K=I+P$$ so $$R\leq I+P$$.  The
quantity $$r=R/(I+P)$$, the ratio of staking rewards reinvestment over
issuance and priority fees is one of the distinguishing features of
our model, and also why we have split the staking queue flow $$R+Q_+$$.
These are our motivations:

1. Modeling $$r$$ is absolutely necessary to model LSTs.[^rlst]
2. We want to separate the *transient* externally-driven dynamics $$Q_+$$ from the
long-term endogenous feedback $$R$$,[^rdyn]
3. $$r$$ could be measured and monitored with onchain data, and
4. Low $r$ might be hazardous.

If the $$\tau$$ required to achieve $$r=R/(I+P)<1$$ in practice
becomes too large, one might refine the approximations used to model
issuance, or use data to better model $$\dot{V}$$.  In neither case do
we expect this to make a huge qualitative difference for the issues
considered here, but please, prove us wrong!

## Intensive Flows give Dynamical Systems

Flows obey inequalities, usually as a fraction of the source, except
for $r,b$. We convert these inequalities; for each uppercase
*extensive* flow $$(J,F,B,\ldots)$$ we define a lowercase *intensive
variable[^intensive] $$(\jmath,f,b,\ldots)$$ with \[units\]: the
fractions \[1\] and fractional rates \[1/yr\].  In forming these, the
ideal is to apply the tightest available bounds that still capture the
asymptotic behavior[^asym] in the limit of interest $$S\to A$$.  We do
not assume the intensive parameters are constant, but suppress their
dependence for readability.  Unless otherwise stated, the intensives
are functions of the dynamical variables and time, so the burn:
$$b(A,S,t)=B/F$$.[^time]

### Table of Flows

| Flow Name | Symbol | Domain $$\to$$ Codomain[^cats] | Constraint | Intensive | Range \[Units\] |    
| :--              | :--    | :-:                 | :--        | :-- | :-- |
| Tx Fees          | $$F$$    | $$U\to\cancel{O},V$$  | $$0<B+P=F<U$$ | $$f:=F/U$$ | $$f\in(0,1)$$ [1/yr] |
| Base Fees[^aves] | $$B$$    | $$U\to\cancel{O}$$    | ..       | $$b:=B/F$$ | $$b\in(0,1)$$ \[1\] |

The use of intensive variable parameters and the approximation
$$\dot{V}\approx0$$ allows us to reshape our conceptual model into one
that is defined in its own dynamical and intensive variables, a
*dynamical system*.  We'll build this up one step at a time.  As you
follow along you may find it useful to look at models in python.  You
can use these *extremely* rough estimates of constant parameters along
with $A_{now}\approx120e6,\ s_{now}\approx.3$ as a start for the
models that follow.

```python
from ethode import *
@dataclass
class ConstParams(Params):
    y1: 1/Yr = 166.3
    b: One = 5e-1
    f: 1/Yr = 8e-3
    j: 1/Yr = 1e-5
    r: One = .65
    qs: 1/Yr = 1e-4
    qu: 1/Yr = 1e-4
    s1: ETH = 1
    def yld(self, S:ETH, **kwargs) -> 1/Yr:
        return self.y1 * np.sqrt(self.s1 / S)
```

### $$(S,U)$$; not just a UNIX Command!

With the above, you should be able to construct the following $$(S,U)$$ system:

$$\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rrrlcrl}
\dot{S} &=& \ \ (ry-\jmath-q_-) & S & + & \ \ \left(q_++r(1-b)f\right) & U\\
\dot{U} &=& \left((1-r)y+q_-\right) & S & - & \left(rf+(1-r)bf+q_+\right) & U\\
\end{array}
$$

These coefficients of staked $$S$$ and unstaked $$,U$$ ETH are
miserably complicated-looking, but as written they are all (but one)
positive, and so we can reason about this model's evolution.
Specifically, so long as $$ry(S)>\jmath+q_-$$ staked ETH $$S$$ just
continues growing and growing.  In contrast it is harder for $$U$$ to
get as big, limited by its own loss term
$$-\left(rf+(1-r)bf+q_+\right) U$$.  At some point in the (far) future
$$S$$ becomes big enough that $$ry(S)<\jmath+q_-$$ and the system
becomes *capable* of oscillation, depending on parameters and a zoo of
partial derivatives.[^SU]

```python
@dataclass
class SUConstParams(ConstParams):
    init_conds: ETH_Data = (('S', 120e6 * .3), ('U', 120e6 * .7))
    tspan: tuple[Yr, Yr] = (0, 100)
@dataclass
class SUConstSim(ODESim):
    params: Params = field(default_factory = SUConstParams)
    @staticmethod
    def func(t:Yr, v:tuple[ETH, ETH], p:Params) -> tuple[ETH/Yr, ETH/Yr]:
        S, U = v
        dS = (p.r * (y := p.yld(S)) - p.j - p.qu) * S + \
            ((rf := p.r * p.f) * (1 - p.b) + p.qs) * U
        dU = ((1 - p.r) * y + p.qu) * S - \
            (rf + (1 - p.r) * p.b * p.f + p.qs) * U
        return dS, dU
su = SUConstSim()
su.sim()
```

These dynamic variables are kind of boring, but critically and unlike
$$(A,S)$$, there are *no extra conditions* (such as $$S<A$$) that we
haven't told the math about.  The equations are not
[stiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation); they can be
simulated without too much pain, though we always recommend to backup
a simulation result with some analysis: numerical regimes can miss
important dynamics when perturbation series are insufficient.  Most
importantly, the variables of interest in the ongoing debate are
functions of $$S,U$$, so we lose nothing by calculating them
post-simulation; we'll demonstrate how.  Even as we change dynamical
variables for intuition building, we recommend using models like
$$(S,U)$$ as a base for simulation whenever possible.

### Inflation

Inflation is used to refer to many things, but here we mean
specifically the quarterly fractional change in accessible Ether.
Consider $$\alpha:=\dot{A}/A\approx(I-B-J)/A$$ in light of the [above
table](#table-of-flows).   In general and under
the existing yield curve we have (where $$\beta=bf=B/U$$):[^noburn]

$$\displaystyle
\alpha\ \approx\ y(sA)s-\beta(1-s)-\jmath s \ =\ y_0(1)\sqrt{s/A}-\beta(1-s)-\jmath s
$$

You can explore this by adding `alpha(), sfrac()` as `@output` methods

```python
@dataclass
class SUaConstParams(SUConstParams):
    @output
    def sfrac(self, S:ETH, U:ETH) -> One:
        return S / (S + U)
    @output
    def alpha(self, S:ETH, U:ETH) -> 1/Yr:
        s = self.sfrac(S,U)
        return self.yld(S) * s - self.b * self.f * (1 - s) - self.j * s
@dataclass
class SUaConstSim(SUConstSim):
    params: Params = field(default_factory = SUaConstParams)
su_a = SUaConstSim()
su_a.sim()
```

### Persistent inflation cannot maintain

A key feature of $$\dot{A}$$ under the current yield curve $$y_0(S)$$
is sublinear issuance $$I\leq yS\lesssim S$$, chosen to avoid
[discouragement
attacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/research/master/papers/discouragement/discouragement.pdf).
Because of this, positive inflation cannot maintain indefinitely.  We
will demonstrate with the existing yield curve, but the argument is
general.  Unusually for this blog post, we show most of the steps
so the argument is hopefully understood.  Elsewhere we use $I\approx
yS$, but here we use $I\leq yS$ as greater [rigor](#bounding-issuance) is appropriate.

$$\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rcl}
dA = \alpha Adt  &\leq&  \left(ys-\beta(1-s)-\jmath s\right)Adt\\
dA  &\leq&  ysAdt = y_0(1)\sqrt{sA}dt \leq y_0(1)\sqrt{A}dt\\
\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)}A^{-1/2}dA  &\leq&  \int_0^{\ t} y_0(1)dt\\
\left.\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{A}\right|^{\sqrt{A(t)}}_{\sqrt{A(0)}}  &\leq&  y_0(1)t\\
A(t)  &\leq&  \left(\sqrt{A(0)}+2y_0(1)t\right)^2\\
\therefore A(t) &\lesssim& t^2 \ll  e^{kt} ~\forall ~\mathrm{const.}~k>0
\end{array}
$$

The last line is Vinogradov asymptotic notation, used in the rest of
this post[^asym] For two positive functions, $$g$$ dominates $$f$$,
written $$f(t)\ll g(t)$$ just when
$$\lim_{t\to\infty}[f(t)/g(t)]=0$$. When the limit is a non-zero
constant we say $f\sim g$. We use $\gg/\ll/\sim$ for numbers as well,
by which we mean the order of magnitude is much larger / much smaller
/ similar.

The point.  Since supply $$A(t)$$ is *eventually* less than a powerlaw of $$t$$,
it is *subexponential*.  Thus, no positive rate of Ether supply
expansion can maintain indefinitely.[^caveat]

This does not mean we would find every intermediate inflation rate
pleasant.  Following surges in $$Q_+$$ and/or drops in supply,
inflation can accelerate quite alarmingly.  A good example will be the
Ethereum staking-mania following the 2132 Atlantia-v-Eurasia market
crash, in which 99% of present-day Ether will have been burned.

```python
@dataclass
class MegaBurnParams(SUaConstParams):
    init_conds: ETH_Data = (('S', 1.2e6 * .4), ('U', 1.2e6 * .6))
    tspan: tuple[Yr, Yr] = (0, 200)
    b: One   = 1e-3
    qs: 1/Yr = 2e-1
@dataclass
class MegaBurnSim(SUaConstSim):
    params: Params = field(default_factory = MegaBurnParams)
zomg = MegaBurnSim()
zomg.sim()
```

![Disaster Scenario](
    ../assetsPosts/2025-01-17-issuance-dynamics/mega-burn.png)

We aren't excited to hodl through multiple decades of 10% inflation,
and we expect you aren't either!  Silliness aside, we encourage you to find more
realistic scenarios in which such sustained inflation occurs.

We mean to separate concerns, not dismiss inflation as a problem.
Unpleasantly high inflation in the medium term, even if that "medium
term" lasts decades, is a *dynamics* problem, not an equilibrium
problem, and so dynamical solutions (like EIP 7514) seem better
suited.  Unfortunately we will see that given the above,
$$s^\star\to1$$ *is* an equilibrium problem.

### Staking Fraction

We have equations for $$\dot{A},\dot{S}$$, what about
$$\dot{s}=d(S/A)/dt$$?  Using the quotient rule
$$\dot{s}=\frac{\dot{S}}{A}-s\frac{\dot{A}}{A}$$, and after an algebraic
massage, we obtain for staking fraction

$$\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{s} &=& y(sA)\ (r-s) + \\
 && \left[q_++f(1-s)\left(bs +(1-b)r\right)\right]\cdot(1-s) + \\
 && \left[\jmath(1-s+r)+q_-\right]\ (0-s).
\end{array}
$$

The coefficients of $$(r-s),\ (1-s),\ (0-s)$$ are variable but *positive*.
Recalling how $$s$$ increases just when $$\dot{s}>0$$, these terms draw
$$s$$ toward respective points $$r,1,0$$.  We emphasize that the action of
yield $$y$$ is $$x\to r$$, which may not be the same as $$x\to1$$.

As expressed by the quotient rule, an increase in staking fraction
can be driven by more people staking, and/or it can be driven by a
reduction of the inflation rate.  The latter can be achieved in
principle by a reduction of issuance relative to the base fee "burn
rate".  Because of this quotient rule tradeoff, issuance plays a
beneficial "infrastructure" role in moderating staking fraction,
drawing it toward $$r$$, which can be less than one.

### $$(A,\alpha,s)$$ Dynamical System

There are many reasons, especially in the context of the world
economy, to care about total circulating supply $$A$$.  Recent
discussions however have focused most on inflation $$\alpha=\dot{A}/A$$,
the growth in supply over time.  It also turns out that modeling
inflation $$\alpha$$ directly simplifies our analysis of the $$(A,s)$$
system considerably.

Let subscripts denote partial derivatives
$$x_y:=\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{y}}$$.  Using the correct partial
derivative relations for variables $$(A,\alpha,s,t)$$[^partial] we have

$$\displaystyle

Where the new greek letters are fractional rates, defined below, and

* $$\mu:=\beta_\alpha(1-s)+\jmath_\alpha s$$ is the implicit
  sensitivity of the inflation loss-term to increases in inflation.
  We judge $$0\leq\mu$$; if anything inflation increases burn and
  slashing fractional rates.[^mu]

* $$\xi:=(y+y'A+\beta-\beta_s(1-s)-\jmath-\jmath_s)/(1+\mu)$$ is the net
  correlation between changes in $$s$$ and changes in $$\alpha$$
  normalized by $$1+\mu$$. $$\xi$$ can be of either sign.  Under the
  current yield curve $$y_0+\frac{dy}{dS}A=y_0(sA)(1-1/(2s))$$, which
  changes its sign at 50% ETH staked.

* $$\gamma:=\jmath_{\log{A}}s+\beta_{\log{A}}(1-s)+s|y'|A$$ is a
  positive coefficient expressing how quickly $$\alpha\to\alpha^\star$$,

  inflation loss term encoded as explicit time-dependencies.  We
  neglect externalities $$\chi\approx0$$ because we have nothing
  intelligent to say about them, but you might not want to.

We don't recommend modeling this numerically; these equations *are*
stiff.  We use it for mathematical analysis only.

#### Separation of Timescales and $$\alpha>0$$

Observe that every term in $$(\xi,\gamma)$$ are small fractions,
fractional rates, or derivatives thereof.  Indeed, when
$$\alpha\approx0$$ and sensitivities are weak, $$|\xi|\sim\gamma\sim y$$
obtains.  Generally if $$|\xi|,\gamma\ll1$$ then the derivatives obey
$$|\dot{\alpha}|\ll|\dot{s}|$$: a [separation of
timescales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_averaging).  For
durations when this obtains, one or more periods at intermediate
times, inflation can be usefully approximated as a parameter instead
of its own dynamic variable, with staking fraction equilibrating to
$$s^\star$$ more quickly than $$\alpha^\star$$ equilibrates.

Does this hold presently?  For a sanity-check, a quick look at YCharts
since Sept 2022 (the Merge) shows that $$s,\dot{s}$$ do indeed seem to vary over a
much greater range than $$(\log{A},\alpha)$$ under Proof-of-Stake.

For the remainder of this post, we will assume this obtains.
Anecdotally, even when it does not, the revealed interplay between
inflation and staking fraction shows up, and is a very important
concept for Ethereum macroeconomics.

# Staking Fraction in 1D

Recall our approximate equation for the fraction of staked ETH $$s$$, in
which all coefficients are positive but inflation $$\alpha$$:

$$\displaystyle
\dot{s} = \alpha\ (r-s) + (rf+q_+)\ (1-s) + (q_-+(1-r)\jmath)\ (0-s)
$$

So assuming $$|\dot{\alpha}|\ll|\dot{s}|$$, let us examine the fixed
point $$s^\star$$ during a period in which we may treat inflation as
constant $$\alpha=\alpha_{const}$$.

$$\displaystyle
s^\star =
   \frac{r^\star(\alpha_{const} + f^\star) + q_+^\star
}{
   m^\star := (\alpha_{const} + r^\star f^\star + q_+^\star + q_-^\star + (1-r)\jmath^\star)
}
= 1 - \frac{(1-r)\jmath+q_-}{m^\star} - \frac{\alpha_0(1-r^\star)}{m^\star}
$$

We will see that without $$\alpha>0$$ an interior market equilibrium is
very unlikely.  First, as a thought experiment, consider $$\alpha=0$$.

## Concerning Churn

A fixed point $$s^\star(\alpha=0)<1$$ would require either high churn or
a persistent unstaking/capitulation of existing validators
$$q_-+\jmath>0$$.  Validators try to minimize slashing as intended, but what would a
large unstaking flow $$q_-s\gtrsim rf$$ at $$s^\star$$ mean?

High unstaking requires *churn*, a persistent supply of new validators
to take their place $$q_+^\star(1-s)\sim q_-s\gtrsim rf$$, or it is only
a transient and $$q_-^\star\ll rf$$; recall that reinvestment by
existing validators is not counted in $$q_+$$.  Persistently high
unstaking $$q_-\sim rf$$ could only describe a market equilibrium if
one group of stakers was actively capitulating and withdrawing their
stake, while another group with a higher $$r$$ were aggressively
reinvesting in their business, and their reinvestment of fees and MEV
offset the unstaking, adjusted for inflation.

High churn, not counting reinvestment, cannot maintain forever:
eventually there will be no new Capitulators left, and $$s^\star$$
must once again grow as required by the Reinvestors' higher $$r$$, so
$$s^\star$$ was not a fixed point at all.  So $$q_-^\star\ll
(rf)^\star$$.

Similarly, at some point everyone who wants to stake should have
staked.  If we judge the $$\tau$$-averaged flows due to the issuance of
new humans and the burn rate of legacy humans to be small, additional
validators count overwhelmingly toward $$r^\star$$ and
$$q_+^\star\ll(rf)^\star$$.  Thus, the fixed point $$s^\star$$
simplifies to

$$\displaystyle
s^\star \approx r^\star \frac{\alpha_{const} + f^\star}{
    \alpha_{const} + r^\star f^\star + (1-r^\star)\jmath^\star}
$$

We will explore the *stability* of this fixed point below, and based on
the range of $$\alpha$$ categorize three basic behaviors.

## Stability in One Dimension

Fixed-points are market equilibria just when they are
stable.[^stability] Local stability is easy to asses for one
dimensional maps.  In general a fixed point is locally stable when
small changes (*perturbations*) shrink over time.  For a continuous
map $$\dot{x}(x)$$ like ours, this concerns the derivative of the RHS
at the fixed point.  If it is negative, then small perturbations
shrink and the fixed point is a stable *sink*, and $x$
"flows"[^flowflux] toward it.  If the derivative is zero, the fixed
point is a degenerate *center*, unrealistic outside of physics.  If
positive, the fixed point is an unstable *source* and repels $x$.

![1D Stability Conditions](
   ../assetsPosts/2025-01-17-issuance-dynamics/1d-stab.jpg)

Specifically for staking fraction, we want the sign of
$$\left.\frac{\partial\dot{s}}{\partial s}\right|^\star$$ to determine
whether $$s^\star$$ is (un)stable.  We will be ignoring the partial
derivatives ("sensitivities") by assuming they are small in comparison
with their corresponding intensives.[^small-part] The full no-churn
stability condition, including variations in $\alpha$ is (with
subscripts denoting partials)

$$\displaystyle
(\alpha^\star/f^\star)\ +\ r\ +\ (\jmath^\star/f^\star)\ \ >\ \
\log{r}_{\log s}^\star\left[
(\alpha^\star/f^\star)\ +\ (1/r^\star-1/s^\star)
(\alpha/f)_r^\star\right]
$$

If we assume that sensitivities are dominated by their respective
intensives, this reduces to a simple
$$\alpha^\star+r^\star f^\star \gtrsim -\jmath^\star$$.

Weak Deflation.  If $$-(rf+(1-r)\jmath)^\star<\alpha_{const}\leq0$$ then an
interior market equilibrium $$s^\star$$ requires high slashing, as we
argued before based on Churn.  All other things being equal, it is
also less stable.  Assuming low slashing continues, as validators must
pay the cost themselves so are incentivized to minimize it, then
$s^\star>1$ and runaway staking is inevitable if the fixed point is
stable: the numerator is larger than the denominator.  If unstable,
$s$ is pushed toward zero, and in practice becomes unpredictable by
our model: externalities intervene to do... something.

Strong deflation.  Consider now $$\alpha<-(rf+(1-r)\jmath)^\star$$.  This could
happen for instance if the issuance curve were reduced particularly
bluntly, or changes in fundamentals drove either MEV or the base fee
(and thus $$f$$) to a persistently higher amount, such that $$ys\ll
bf(1-s)+\jmath s$$.  These conditions cannot maintain of course.  You
don't need differential equations to see that $$\alpha<0$$ shrinks
$$A$$, which eventually raises $$y(sA)$$.  But as a temporary
intervention to tame runaway staking fraction how would this work?
Our fixed point is negative and the simplistic "ignore the constants"
stability criteria is no longer met.  So again, 100% staking becomes
inevitable (the source $s^\star<0$ pushes $s$ instead of pulling it),
or (more likely) the behavior simply becomes unpredictable as
externalities intervene.

There's a lot of potential complexity here, but none of it is
desirable!  If you don't like inflation, wait until you try deflation!
In all seriousness, while we agree largely with the aversion to
inflation in the context of national economies, it is really important
to recognize that those economies have a level of demand diversity and
robustness that Ethereum at present can only dream of.  One day
hopefully we will have the luxury of bemoaning inflation's effects on
hodlers, and reducing it, without fear of the infrastructural dynamics
of these market equilibria running amok.

### Medium $r$; Low Inflation; Even Lower Fees

Well, that was deflating!  Let's cheer ourselves up by considering the
behaviors under $$\alpha_{const}>0$$.  A positive role for inflation can
be seen in the contours of the market equilibrium staking fraction
$$s^\star$$ corresponding to $$\dot{s}=0$$, shown here with
$$\alpha^\star=\alpha_{const}$$ and no slashing.

![alpha vs. s Figure](
    ../assetsPosts/2025-01-17-issuance-dynamics/staking-fixpoint.png).

To find the equilibrium values $$(\alpha^\star/f^\star,\,r^\star)$$
necessary to achieve a desired staking fraction $$s^\star$$, simply
pick a colored contour in the figure: these are the values of constant
$$s^\star$$.  For every point on this curve, the equilibrium
inflation:fee ratio $$\alpha^\star/f^\star$$ is the x-coordinate, and
the equilibrium reinvestment ratio $$r^\star$$ is the y-value.

A breakdown of limiting behaviors is illustrative under positive
inflation.  For any value of non-negative inflation, $$r^\star$$ is a
lower bound for the equilibrium staking fraction we should expect.  If
inflation dominates fees, $$\alpha_{const}\gg f^\star$$ then
$$s^\star$$ is larger by a very small amount than $$r^\star$$, while
if fees dominate inflation $$0<\alpha_{const}\ll f^\star$$ then
$$s^\star$$ becomes insensitive to non-zero reinvestment ratio and
$$s^\star\to1$$.  In the intermediate range $r^\star
f^\star\sim\alpha^\star$, $r^\star < s^\star$ still but the gap is
bigger.

For a numerical comparison, eyeballing charts (so *extremely* rough
approximations here, possibly off by an order of magnitude, maybe more) $$rf
\approx .004\sim.005\approx\alpha$$ so to within 15-20% error above,
$$s^\star\approx r^\star$$ over the range of $$r\in(.5,.75)$$ inferred
from the Lido yield rate.  Clearly we are not yet at equilibrium, or
$r$ is much lower than our extremely rough estimates.

How the transient values $$(\alpha_{now}/f,r)$$ relate to the true
equilibrium values $$(\alpha^\star/f^\star,r^\star)$$ depends on
some considerations:

* If indeed churn dies down and slashing stays relatively rare, then
  $$r$$ increases to reflect the growing share of businesses that
  reinvest the most; $$r^\star\approx r_{max}$$, where $$r_{max}$$ is
  assessed over all staking pools with at least 10% of $$S$$.

* We are holding $$\alpha_{const}=\alpha^\star$$, so
  $$\alpha_{now}\approx\alpha^\star$$ but a more sophisticated approximation
  is likely possible keeping within the two-timescale context... maybe
  you'll find one!

### Runaway $$r$$ from Inflation pressure

Could the sensitivity $$r_\alpha$$ be sufficient such that even at
intermediate timescales we see $$s^\star\to1$$?  This is certainly possible;
per the arguments of Ethereum researchers, high inflation could still
lead to runaway staking if $$r$$ is sensitive enough.

In our model the net effect of inflation on staking fraction 
equilibrium is reflected by taking the derivative
$$0<\left.\frac{ds^\star}{d\alpha}\right|^\star$$ assuming $$r,f$$ are
implicit functions of $$\alpha$$.  That is, the necessary condition
for inflation to push the market equilibrium $$s^\star$$ itself into
runaway staking is (see below for explanation):

$$\displaystyle
1 \ \ < \ \
\left(\frac{\partial\log\ r}{\partial\log\ \alpha}\right)^\star
\cdot \frac{1 + \alpha^\star/f^\star}{1 - r^\star} \ \ + \ \
\left(\frac{\partial\log\ f}{\partial\log\ \alpha}\right)^\star
$$

In practice it all depends on what ETH users consider sufficiently
"high" inflation to respond; the above conditions just reflect a
quantification of this preference.  We hope that this work can be
built upon to determine what threshold of inflation or business
conditions satisfy the above condition.  No mean feat, but it would help focus
inflationary pressure arguments into empirically measurable assertions
that can be tracked for Ethereum health.

### Whence "Mr"; Dangers of Low $r$

Before you start advocating for "EIP 7514 On Steroids" on crypto
twitter (that is, throttling the staking queue to prevent $r$ from
rising, such as due to inflation-pressure), consider the danger of low
staking, that is low $r$ in the absence of significant churn.  In the
simplified staking fraction equation, the term $\alpha(r-s)$ is
positive only when $s<r$ and $\alpha>0$... what if
$r\to\epsilon\ll{s_{now}}$ for some reason?  Then the only positive
term $(rf+q_+)(1-s)$ gets very small in the absence of new staking.
But, given sufficient inflation and fees and very marginal
sensitivities, the stability requirement $\alpha+rf+\jmath>0$ could
still obtain, so the new fixed point, presuming inflation maintains in
LI;ELF territory, $s^\star\sim\epsilon$ remains stable.

That's quite a lot of ifs, but consider exponential growth of supply
under present issuance: $y_1\sqrt{sA}$... $A\sim e^{\alpha t}$ can
maintain so long as $s\sim\epsilon + s_{now}e^{-\alpha t}$.  For
roughly $\alpha^{-1}\log\epsilon^{-1}$ Ethereum could in principle
experience simultaneously lowered security, and consistent inflation.
For small $\epsilon$ and $\alpha\sim.1$ that's more than a decade in
principle.  Whether this has any bearing on reality, we don't know,
but its worth being aware of.  In the
[guide](https://github.com/20squares/ethode/blob/master/guide/guide.md)
we will be adding upper limits on the time-duration of inflation as
time-permits.


# Concluding Discussion

We saw above a few things:

1. Reinvestment $$r$$ is a lower-bound for the staking fraction fixed point $$s^\star$$
   unless Ether is deflating, when likely $s\to1$ or the dynamics are unstable.
1. Low (but positive) inflation moderates staking fraction closer to this lower bound
   at intermediate timescales
1. Positive inflation cannot maintain indefinitely, so eventually $$s^\star\to1$$.

Conceptually, how can inflation *moderate* staking fraction, though?
Shouldn't more staking lead to more issuance, which leads to more
inflation, etc.?  Briefly the reasons are:

* Short $$Q_+$$ vs. Long Term $$R$$ Investment
* The Quotient Rule $$\dot{S}=\dot{S}/A-s\dot{A}/A$$

## Short Term vs. Long Term.

Novel investment in staking $$Q_+$$ is driven largely by speculation,
and new users encountering Ethereum.  $$Q_+$$ acts to increase staking
fraction, as seen above, and indeed the glut in $$Q_+$$ since the Merge
may have been the source for much of the alarm that prompted this
study. Novel speculative investment must eventually dry up, and be
replaced by long-term investment $$R$$, because

1. everyone with money who wants to stake eventually will, so will be
counted in $$R$$ not $$Q_+$$
2. any business that wants to stay in
business cannot consistently reinvest more than its revenue $$R\leq
I+P$$ (issuance plus priority fees).

Of the long term signal $$R$$, only the issuance portion of
reinvestment, that is the part that contributes to inflation, can
moderate $$s$$, which brings us to the quotient rule.

## The Quotient Rule

$$\displaystyle
\dot{s}\ \ =\ \ \frac{\dot{S}}{A}\ -\ \frac{S\dot{A}}{A^2}\ \ =\ \ \frac{\dot{S}}{A}\ -\ s\alpha
$$

What increases $$s$$ is any increase in staked Ether $$S$$, but also any
net decrease in $$A=S+U$$. Inflation $$\alpha$$ increases *both* $$U$$ and
$$S$$, because some of that increase is used to meet costs and take
profit $$(1-r)\alpha$$, which increases $$U$$ relative to $$S$$.  In
contrast, the reinvestment of transaction fees can only ever increase
$$S$$ at the expense of $$U$$.  Thus transaction fees always act to
increase staked fraction, while the effect of inflation depends on the
relative values of reinvestment ratio and staking fraction.

So, while we could certainly model reinvestment differently, and there
are lags we are blithely integrating over, we think that these market
forces will still act as described above in a different model.  It is
possible that even during sustained inflation, these effects will be
unable to prevent the upward creep in $$s$$, because $$r$$ is too
large, or the sensitivity of $$r$$ to inflation at equilibrium is too
great, a condition which we mathematized above.  In fact we expect
that every argument about inflation effects driving increased staking,
overpaying for security, etc. could (perhaps should) be rephrased in
terms of reinvestment of staking rewards.  All these critically depend
on the preferences of ETH users for, and thus their behavior in
reaction to, inflation rate etc., which thusfar are not measured, as
far as we know.  We encourage the community to rectify this!

## Can reflexivity prevent $$s\to1$$?

Regarding the possible effects of reflexivity.  We have neglected even
discussing oscillations in $$(S,U)$$, even though the model is plainly
capable of such behavior under different parameters or when coupled to
price.  Why such negligence?  If cycles *do* arise, we expect market
participants, anticipating such cycles, would act to profit off of
these cycles in a way that should reduce them.  Buy late in the
inflation cycle, sell late in the deflation cycle, etc.  This would show
up in our model via the partial derivatives including externalities.

Notably though, we only expect this to happen because
it does not require the coordination of market participants: each
individual blindly pursuing their own utility should help en masse
control these oscillations, or they were never very great to begin
with.

Could there be a similar effect with staking fraction or inflation?
In short we have no idea, but put it as a challenge to the reader.
Can you devise a cryptoeconomic protocol or trading strategy that
forestalls the seemingly inevitable $$s^\star\to1$$?  If not, can you
prove this is impossible?

## Should We Change $$y$$?

So, finally... should the Ethereum community reduce issuance?

### Glib answer

No.

### Short answer

Let's adopt a dynamical solution to a dynamical problem.  If you are
very inflation averse or you want to slow down the transition to high
staking, please study and simulate downward adjusting the constants in
EIP 7514, adopted during the Deneb upgrade.  This already directly
limits $$R+Q_+$$, but was very nicely designed to not interfere with
existing staking flows.  It would be particularly interesting to see
if $R$ can be safely decoupled from limits on $Q_+$, to avoid the
potential danger of low-$r$ scenarios.  EIP 7514 does not solve, and does not
claim to solve, the long term problems, but we have been forced to
conclude that reducing issuance doesn't solve them either!

### Long answer

Ask the users, especially the validators, especially the LSPs.  Model
user preferences so that the demand curve becomes semi-empirical
instead of theorized.  Near-100% staking seems to be baked-in
eventually, as persistent inflation cannot sustain under an issuance yield
curve designed to avoid discouragement.

So the question becomes essentially "How bad will it get in the
meantime?"  We recommend of course that you use these tools to run
simulations.  But that is only half the answer... this is really a
question about user preferences.  Austrian School devotees may be so
inflation-averse that they are already staking all their
previously-liquid ETH at $$\alpha\approx0.5$$%/yr.  In contrast users
who were content to grow up with fiat currencies during periods of
$$\approx3$$% inflation or even worse might not care, or would just
stake in Compound or buy stETH.

For users seeking to passively preserve wealth, staking in Compound
(or Aave, or whatever) is ideal for generating raw Ether demand, of
course.  Staking in LSTs, such as stETH, though concerning from a
governance angle, may present less of an issue than some have feared.
LSPs must share some yield with users in order to have users, but if
they want to stay in business they must maintain $$r_{LST}<1$$, and
both profit-taking and covering fiat-denominated costs go into
unstaked Ether $U$.

So how high can $$r_{LST}$$ go before LSPs find the loss of gross
profits unacceptable?  Great question.  We will see next time that as
many have recognized, the entity/group $i$ that can maintain the highest
$$r_i$$ wins the race eventually.  It's worth noting however that if you
apply price uncertainty via a risk-discounting rate of, well anything
really, you will see that the "maximize $$r_{mine}$$" strategy is far
from the most profitable, risk-adjusted.  Of course, a speculative
investor seeking to profit from our analysis would find our study
woefully short of details.  Put another way, since you have insisted on
reading the "long answer", we will end with the classic and cowardly
refrain of academics and academic-adjacents everywhere "it requires
more research!"

# Footnotes

[^humor]: [Open Zeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) is an early
icon of smart contract best practices, and continues to provide
templates and auditing services in high demand.  They have absolutely
no connection to this post, our models, etc. and hopefully they will
not sue us for using their name in a bad dynamical systems joke.

[^reasons]: For derivations involving differential equations, `D`
(used for staking Deposit) and its corresponding intensive `d` are
cursed variables. `s` was already in use in some places for staking
fraction, and we are resolute on keeping the intensive and its
corresponding extensive the same letter.  `C` is a more natural choice
for circulating supply, but then the three variables of most interest
are something like `(C,s,ς)` which is masochistic in its sibilance, even
for squares.  We prefer "accessible" to circulating because the former
implies you *could* access it, at some cost, while the latter
sometimes implies a velocity of money.  A velocity which `S` and much of
`U` may lack depending on dynamics: backed up unstaking queue, leveraged
or looped CDPs, etc.  But even if our terminology were actually
superior, we're not going to change economic jargon any time soon.

[^aves]: We use moving quarterly averages, though any timescale `τ`
sufficiently long that the
[erratic](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-10-eip1559/)
and [fast dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10567) of [the base
fee](https://ethereum.github.io/abm1559/notebooks/eip1559.html) are
integrated out, and the lags from (un)staking queues are not
appreciable.  As we are averaging quarterly, we set the staking,
unstaking, and reward queues to zero, including their respective flows
`(R+Q+,Q-,I+P)` in their codomain stocks `(S,U,V)`; even if ethereum
produces empty blocks, so long as the reward queue is not empty `U >
0`. See also our [section](#bounding-issuance) on `I<=yS`.

[^partial]: Sometimes "dot x" `=dx/dt` is used for the partial
derivative of `x` with time `t`, which we denote `x_t`.  The full relation
is `dx = x_t + x_A dA + x_s ds + x_α dα` in which each partial is
taken holding all the other variables constant, and `x_t` is used in
practice to smuggle in any variability from non-dynamical
variables. In principle `x_A` and `x_α` are distinct; a quantity can
depend on supply (how big ETH market cap is compared to BTC, say) and
inflation independently.

[^yield]: For anyone from finance, this is *not* the same as a [bond
yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp);
there is essentially no necessary lag for validator rewards,
accounting quarterly.

[^cats]: We use domain/codomain in imprecise analogy with category
theory mainly because we want to reserve "source" for an attractor, as
per dynamical systems.  The analogy, while inexact is not
inappropriate.  It is routine to implicitly use associativity to
account for fibers of flows through multiple steps; "electricity from
wind/nuclear/gas" even though the electrons are
indistinguishable. Flows such as tx fees `U--F-->V,Ø` involve a
categorical product `VxØ` in that the smaller fractional flows
`U--B-->Ø` must factor through it. Similarly the staking queue
`V+(U-V)---R+Q+-->S` involves a coproduct in the domain.  Whether
there is content here beyond "flows correspond to injective maps
between measurable sets" is unclear.  None of this matters in the
least for Ethereum dynamics, of course.  If you're reading it consider
this an easter egg / attempt to detect a living and alert audience.

[^time]: We can often use the dependence on `t` to smuggle in any
forces, like market panics, etc. that we neglected to include as
dynamical variables.  If we cannot add something essential this way,
we must add a dynamical variable.

[^intensive]: The use here is related to but slightly different than
the simplified use "independent of systemm size" [common in
thermodynamics](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties).
Specifically we use that Ether is something *preserved* in the flow to
bound the measure of the flow by the size of its domain above and zero
below, with subleading terms possible.  So `B ~ U - log(1+U) -
U**(1/2)` is possible but `B ~ U + U**2` and `B ~ U - U**2` are out.
We care most about the limit `S -> A (U -> 0)`; see[^asym] also[^elowex]
other[^whyr] footnotes[^params] for[^noburn] examples[^mu] and context.

[^elowex]: Why not simply choose `B = bA`, essentially as was done in
[this 2021 post](
    https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954)
by Elowsson?  (We use `S` for his `D` and `A` for his `S`.[^reasons])
Obviously if there is no unstaked Ether no one can afford tx
fees. Here `s` is a *dynamical variable*, so `b = B(A-S) = bf(1-s)A`
is more appropriate for our model.  The function B might do all kinds
of complicated nonsense, but it can never go negative and it can never
exceed U.

[^whyr]: Intensives expressed as fractions of flows such as `R/(I+P)`,
instead of fractional rates of sources (like `J/S` or `Q_-/S`) occur when
the source dynamical variable, here `V`, is assumed to equilibrate
`dV/dt=0`.  Then the outgoing flows `R+K` must equal the incoming flows
`I+P`, so we choose `R=r(I+P)`. If onchain data indicates, say, $\approx70$%
reinvestment of staking rewards into `S` takes a lot longer than three
months, we would revisit this assumption, though we do not expect our
qualitative results to change re inflation and staking fraction.

[^rlst]: A non-zero `r=R/(I+P)` is built into the smart contract of
every Liquid Staking Provider (LSP).  Here, token-holders provide
Ether and receive a redeemable token (LST) that shares some staking
rewards with them. This fraction of rewards `r_LST` is a lower bound on
`R/(I+P)` at the fixed point.

[^rdyn]: Splitting the staking queue into `R + Q_+` allows us to
somewhat separate short-term *transient* behavior from long-term
dynamics.  Speculative investment in staking by venture capitalists
and novice stakers is expected to die down eventually; either they
give up or they run staking like a business where making a profit
matters.  Every business that wants to stay in business reinvests some
portion of its profits, so `r,R > 0` is what matters in the long run,
once most everyone who wants to stake is staking.

[^flowflux]: Confusingly the movement of a dynamic variable
toward/away-from a fixed point is often also called a "flow". Terms in
equations like `R,J,...` could then be called "fluxes".  But you're not
confused, right?

[^asym]: For computer scientists `f << g` is equivalent to `F = O(g)` if
you're more familiar with big-O notation.  Specifically `I << S` means
that the limit of `I/S` as `t` gets very large is `0`.  Contrast to `I <= yS`,
which could just be a matter of coefficients.  Asymptotic Notation is
well-explained on
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation); see the
bottom for Vinogradov.  The art of using it to your advantage in
calculations is demonstrated by [Prof. Carl
Bender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYNOGk3ZjFM).

[^params]: Variable parameters that are positive fractions cannot
contribute fixed-points themselves, but they can strongly influence
*where* a fixed point is. Example: as `s -> 1`, if the leading terms
were `bf~(1-s)` and `j~(1-s)**2` this gives increasingly larger
equilibrium `A` as `s->1`.

[^vitalikp]: Our `(dlog y)/(dlog S) = 1 - p` in the [discouragement paper](https://github.com/20squares/ethode/blob/master/guide/guide.md)

[^noburn]: Regarding `B = bf(1-s)A` the burn.  While slashing could
believably go to zero on quarterly timescales, no burn `B=0` implies
blocks are empty.  Obviously `s=1, B=0` isn't really a functioning
state for Ethereum.  A better asymptotic limit would be s = 1-ε making
A ~ (1/ε)**2 (that's squared... so very big as ε is very small).
Detailed treatment of the burn, staking queues using expansions in ε
would be necessary here, and are among our desiderata.  We anticipate
the need to model churn, slashing, and burn in light of
stochasticity/quantization.  One can use difference equations or Ito
Calculus, but a useful generic behavior of such systems is obtained in
a "weak coupling" limit. Perturbations due to quantization move the
dynamics away from the fixed point, apparently randomly. Yet!
Somehow, the average rate of precession about `s=1-ε` is often given
by the imaginary component of the largest eigenvalue of the simpler
model.

[^caveat]: A warning!  Simulations are necessarily imperfect, and
especially if you use `method='RK4'` (Runga-Kutta) or other methods
based on local approximations only, it is not hard to find simulations
in which it sure as hell seems like the system has settled down into a
small but positive inflation fixed point.  The following is a useful
sanity check for the existing issuance yield curve, obtained using
Jensen's inequality. An inflation rate α cannot persist longer than
Δt, according to ```exp(α Δt/2) - 1 < 2y1 Δt sqrt(s_ave / A_now)```
where `s_ave` is the average of staking fraction over Δt, `A_now` is
the supply at the beginning of the inflation period, and `y1` is
166.3/yr.

[^mu]: If anything the fractional rates of slashing and burn are
positive with small changes in inflation, due to either a single ETH
potentially being of less real value, or stimulation of economic
activity attracting more validators and higher average burn.

[^ics]: Here gamma `γ` expresses the sensitivity of inflation to supply
initial conditions; the partial `x_A` always holds `(α,s)` constant,
but `dA = α dt` and the partials in gamma are `j_A` and `(bf)_A`.

[^small-part]: Smallness of sensitivities wrt intensives is not
guaranteed. Certainly a large magnitude, say `(bf)_s>1` cannot maintain
for too long; `0<bf<1` afterall.  Locally, a large spike in derivative
`(bf)_s > bf` is still possible.

[^stability]: Global stability involves either trajectories infinitely
returning to a region of the fixed point (think comets) or a
contraction map showing the system shrinking to a limit set.  We won't
rule out global stability, but recommend you look first for locally
stable fixed points.  Assessing the stability of equilibrium zero
inflation in the `(A,s,α)` model is interesting but probably
academic.  One of the eigenvalues at any fixed point with `α=0` is
zero, so higher-order terms matter (the fixed point is degenerate),
and linear-stability analysis is insufficient: we need to care about
global stability not just local.  A reader imbued with mathematical
athleticism and free time is encouraged to think of a Lyapunov
function `л(α=0) = 0 <= л(α)`, and obtain a contraction mapping
`dл(α)/dt <= 0`.

[^SU]: Readers wishing for more detail are encouraged to use the two
dimensional local stability criterion (see [Prof. Steven
Strogatz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yh9DmNqdk4)) to solve for
the condition of eigenvalues with an imaginary part.  But simulate it
too!
